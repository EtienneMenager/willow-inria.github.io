#### Welcome to our group's website!

<br>
[Willow](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) is a joint team between 
[Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-paris-centre), the [computer science department of ENS Paris](https://www.di.ens.fr/set_english), and the [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en).

<br>
We do research in **computer vision, machine learning, robotics, optimization and control**. 

The Willow team was founded in 2007  by [Jean Ponce](https://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce/) as a research team studying representational issues in visual object recognition and scene understanding, with the objective to develop geometric, physical, and statistical models for all components of the image interpretation process, including illumination, materials, objects, scenes, and human activities. 

Since 2021, the team is headed by led by [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io) who has been leading efforts within the team towards robotics and control. Research topics include
-  efficient solvers for robotics control and locomotion
-  differentiable simulation, in particular through contact 
-  intersections between optimal control and reinforcement learning 
-  ...

We also explore the many intersections of robotics, machine learning and computer vision, such as
- sensor-based and in particular visuomotor control
- language-guided computer vision and robotics 
- ...
