**September 11, 2024: Albert De Marchi**

**Constrained Structured Optimization: Formulations and Algorithms**

**Abstract**
Mathematical and computational tools are ubiquitous nowadays, and optimization in various disciplines leads to problems in very different settings. In this talk we discuss finite-dimensional constrained structured programming in the fully nonconvex setting, capturing a variety of problems that include nonsmooth objectives, disjunctive structures, and nonlinear, set-membership constraints. The augmented Lagrangian framework is extended to cover this broad problem class, with established asymptotic properties and convergence guarantees under mild assumptions. Then, we illustrate a technique to avoid slack variables, treating them as implicit variables and taking advantage of certain oracles available. Finally, we will indicate the theoretical challenges that arise in this unexplored territory.

**Short bio**
*Alberto De Marchi is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich, Germany, where he received his doctorate (Dr.rer.nat.) in 2021. In Fall 2022, he was a Visiting Research Associate at Curtin University, WA, Australia. He holds a master degree in Mechatronics Engineering (2016) and a bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering (2014) from the University of Trento, Italy. His scientific activity revolves around computational optimization, and focuses on the design, convergence analysis, numerical properties, and implementation of algorithms for mathematical optimization.*
