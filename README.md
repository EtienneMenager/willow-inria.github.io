# Willow's group website

The website uses [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/). For their original instructions, see [ORIG_README](ORIG_README.md). Here, we maintain a list of (non-obvious) instructions for how to keep the website up to date. 

## Adding seminars
  
Add entry in [_data/seminars.yml](_data/seminars.yml). 

You can specify: "date", "recording", "slides", "academic_institution", "company", "abstract", "bio".
