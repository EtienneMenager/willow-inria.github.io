# Willow's group website

The website uses [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/). For their original instructions, see [ORIG_README](ORIG_README.md). Here, we maintain a list of (non-obvious) instructions for how to keep the website up to date. 

## Add team members

- Add your profile pick to [assets/img/team/](assets/img/team/).
- Add entry in [_data/team.yml](_data/seminars.yml). It doesn't matter where, all members will be sorted by category. 
- Specify the name of your profile pic (without path), your position, and the type: "faculty", "postdoc/engineer", "student", "visitor" and "staff".


## Adding seminars
  
Add entry in [_data/seminars.yml](_data/seminars.yml), following the given example.

You can specify: "date", "recording", "slides", "academic_institution", "company", "abstract", "bio".
